# Supervised Machine Learning Models from scratch

This repository contains implementations of various supervised machine learning algorithms from scratch, including:

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Neural Networks
#
These implementations are designed to demonstrate the underlying mechanics of each algorithm without relying on external machine learning libraries.
